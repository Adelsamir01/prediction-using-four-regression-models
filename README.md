Machine learning, especially regression techniques, has been widely used to estimate a variety of variables in a variety of fields by establishing a relationship between the variable to be estimated and a set of other variables known as independent variables. Two different data sets were used in this project to predict two different output variables using supervised machine learning. Based on the first dataset, the number of violent crimes per 100K population needs to be estimated by considering 120 predictive features. The second predicted variable is the Scaled sound pressure level by looking at frequency, Angle of attack, Chord length, Free-stream velocity, and Suction side displacement thickness. 

For both datasets, four different regression algorithms were used which are: 
1-	Linear Regression
2-	K-Nearest neighbors Regression
3-	Decision Trees Regression
4-	Random Forest Regression
